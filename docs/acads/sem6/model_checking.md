## TLA+

The TLA toolbox has the TLC model checking and TLAPS.

The properties that TLA+ checks:

* Doesn't produce a wrong answer
* Checks conditions on individual executions, not statistical conclusions

A step is a change of state.

An execution is a represented as a sequence of states.

**TLA does not support generalizations**
